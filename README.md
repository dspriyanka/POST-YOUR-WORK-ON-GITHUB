Project Title:  US BIKESHARE DATA


##Description:
•	Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

##The four questions of interest are:
1)	Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2)	Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3)(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4)(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?


•	Statistics Computed
•	You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:
•	#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
•	most common month
•	most common day of week
•	most common hour of day
•	#2 Popular stations and trip
•	most common start station
•	most common end station
•	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
•	#3 Trip duration
•	total travel time
•	average travel time
