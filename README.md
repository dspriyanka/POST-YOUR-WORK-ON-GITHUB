Project Title:  US BIKESHARE DATA


##Description:
•	Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

##The four questions of interest are:
•	Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
•	Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
•	(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
•	(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?


Using technology:

You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
